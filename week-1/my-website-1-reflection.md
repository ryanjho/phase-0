# 1.6 My Reflections

- Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  - How to create a repository on GitHub
    1. Creating a repository on GitHub is easy. Before we go through the steps, it is good to know that a repository is a folder, and GitHub is like an online cloud platform that stores folders and files. 
    2. To create a repository on GitHub, proceed to the github.com and login with your username and password.
    3. Once you are logged in, navigate to the upper-right corner of any page, click the "+" icon and then click "New Repository".
    4. Next, you are required to input your repository name, and make sure that you repository visibility is selected as "Public"
    5. Add an MIT License to your repository
    6. Click "Create repository" and you are done!

 -  How to clone the repository
   	1. On GitHub, go to the repository page that you wish to clone and navigate towards the "HTTPS Clone URL" box located on the right of the webpage
   	2. Copy the link in "HTTPS Clone URL" box
   	3. Launch Terminal application on your computer and navigate to the directory that you wish to clone your repository to
   	4. Type the followoing command line: git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED
   	5. After the command line prompts again, execute the ls command. You should see the folder with the same name as the repository that you had cloned from GitHub

- Describe what open source means.
  - It means software with the original source code made freely available to the public and can be redistributed and modified. Open source software allows anyone to customize the program as they see fit

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  - I feel that Open Source enables constant improvement of software and expands the possibilities that software can achieve by leveraging on the constant efforts of improvement made by developers all around the world. It is a very useful way of crowd-sourcing talent to improve software, and also provides freedom for users to customize according to their own needs.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.
  - Licenses are important tools for developers to hold original copyright on that work, and also the option to grant specific permissions for others to use that work
  - There are different types of licenses (FreeBSD/MIT License, GNU Public License, Mozilla Public License, etc.) It is important to identify which license best suits a user's needs/context, and apply the appropriate license accordingly.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  - The concept of making changes to a file locally, pushing those changes to GitHub and then creating a pull request to merge feature branch to the master branch.
  - Initially, I struggled with understanding the workflow of GitHub. But upon several repititions by working on those exercises, I managed to deepen my understanding of the GitHub workflow, and gradually improved my memory recall of the git commands on the command line

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  - I found the following links particularly useful when trying to understand the workflow of GitHub:
