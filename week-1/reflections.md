# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
From my research, I enjoyed learning more about the Pomodoro technique that involves "Time Boxing" 25 minutes for a stretch of work, and 6 concrete steps. The video on the website was very useful in detailing each of the incremental steps involved and bringing the concept to life. Essentially, time boxing allows a piece of work or task to be broken down into certain chunks of time, with each chunk having a defined duration (in the case of Pomodoro, 25 minutes). Work must strictly stop at the end of each time box, with several minutes allocated at the start for recap, and at the end for review. Implementing the time boxing strategy during Phase 0 will enable me to allocate my time effectively to each task required and ensure that I can track my progress effectively. As I will still be balancing Phase 0 with my current work commitments, time boxing and using the Pomodoro strategy will allow me to stay focused during each time boxed segment and achieve more during each block of time.

Currently, I use check-lists to keep track of the work that I need to complete, and develop sub-bullets with allocated time (although not consistently 25 minutes each) for each bullet. It has worked well for me in my job as a management consultant, as it gives me bite-sized chunks of work that are manageable and help me work towards achieving bigger objectives/tasks. I plan to incorporate the Pomodoro concept into my working approach, particularly having a consistent time boxing unit of 25 minutes per block. This will allow me to instill more discipline in my time management, and enable me to track my progress more effectively. For Phase 0, my overall plan is to allocate a 3 hour block every morning (before work) and split it into 25-minute Pomodoro blocks according to what work needs to be done each day. I believe in consistent working habits, and strive towards maintaining a good level of momentum throughout Phase 0.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is a macro processor that accepts commands from a keyboard and feeds them into an operating system to perform. Bash is the shell for the GNU operating system. One of the most challenging parts while going through the material was remembering the numerous different commands of the command line, and the function of each command. I was able to use almost all of the commands in the Command Line Crash Course tutorial after several attempts, as the tutorial was easy to follow and had detailed instructions. I personally felt that the mkdir (make directory), cd (change directory), cp (copy file/directory) and rm (remove) commands are the most important commands to know. These commands enable the user to perform most of the fundamental functions through bash such as creating files/directories and deleting them.

Here are the following commands:

- pwd print working directory

- ls list directory

- mv move directory or file

- cd change directory

- ../ change directory up

- touch create an empty file

- mkdir make new directory

- less page through file

- rmdir remove directory

- rm remove file

- help finding information about commands and printing it in the terminal

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
A. Create new repository

1. Navigate to your github.com profile page. In the top right navigation bar, click the "+" sign and select "New repository".

2. Input a name for your repository in the box "Repository name", and make sure that the repository visibility is selected as "public".

3. Add an "MIT License" to your repository

4. Click "Create repository" and you would have just created a new repository!

 

**B. Fork a new repository**

1. Search for a repository on github.com that you want to fork (or create a copy)

2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This will make a copy of the repository and store it in your GitHub profile. Making changes to this copy created will not affect the original version of the repository that you had forked from

 

**C. Clone a repository**

1. Go to the repository page that you want to clone and navigate towards the "HTTPS Clone URL" box located on the right.

2. Copy the link in "HTTPS Clone URL" box

3. Launch Terminal on your computer and navigate to the directory that you want to clone the repository to

4. Once in your desired directory, type the following in your command line: git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED

You should see some code being executed,

5. After the command line prompts again, execute the ls command. You should see the folder with the same name as the repository that you had cloned from GitHub.
 

Forking (or creating a copying) a repository allows you to have the freedom to experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking a repository creates an identical copy and eliminates the hassle of creating a new one, which might lead you to create a repository that might not be identical to the initial one.

**Struggles**

The major struggle that I faced was getting familiar with the process of creating a repo, forking a repo, and cloning a repo to my local directory. As using GitHub is completely new to me, it took a while to familiarise myself with the steps, but it gradually got better once I practiced a few times. After this exercise, I learned how to create a repo, fork a repo off GitHub and also clone a repo to my local directory. It also helped me to start learning some of the basic functions of GitHub, which will serve me well in my coding learning journey.
