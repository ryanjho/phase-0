<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  * It was a great experience to put my learning into practice to create the Berkshire Hathaway homepage from scratch. It was fun to work with in a pairing session as we could discuss any questions along the way as we each created the page.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  * It was easy to research and use semantic HTML5 elements just because of the fact that a semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. It was great to know that HTML5 includes a whole new slew of semantic elemnts to define different parts of a webpage, making it easier and faster for developers to write HTML.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  * I felt that I did well at keeping to HTML best practices, like making sure that indentation is neat and easy to read, and making sure to leave formatting out of HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
 * The great thing about HTML is that it is relatively straightforward to master. It is mostly about being familiar with syntax, and understanding how information can be organized on the webpage
 * The bad thing about HTML is the lack of computing logic or power available. Afterall, the main purpose of HTML is for content markup, and is layered on top with traditional programming languages like ruby or python to provide the computing logic and power.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  * The main trick that I use to remember HTML syntax is thinking of common terms that I would use to describe how I want to organize content. For example, if I want to create an ordered list, I can remember that the syntax for HTML involves the first letter of each word in "ordered list", so the command will be <ol></ol>.
