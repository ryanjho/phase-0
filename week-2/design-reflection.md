1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
- The 6 Phases of Web Design are the following:
  1. Information Gathering
    - Gather information about business goals, considering Purpose, Goals, Target Audience and Content
  2. Planning
    - Developing a site-map which serves as a guide as to what content will be on the site
  3. Design
    - Considering target audience, and creating one or more prototype designs for the website
  4. Development
    - Incorporate graphical elements from the prototype to create the actual, functional site. 
  5. Testing and Delivery
    - Testing the functionality of website (e.g. forms, scripts) as well as last minute compatibility issues
  6. Maintenance
    - Providing consistent maintenance as the website continues to develop and evolve

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  - My website's primary goal is to improve my employability as a junior web developer and establish a strong following to my blog. My main target audience are companies looking for someone with both business strategy and technology expertise, and people interested to learn both strategy and technology.
  - My site will feature an overview of myself, my blog posts, a record of my professional experiences (resume), a portfolio of my past work, and my contact information

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  - My target audience are interested to find out more about my technology and business background, see how I think and approach problems, as well as have a snapshot of my past work.
  - I see my website as a useful lens in which they can quickly view my experiences and qualifications. I have also included a "Contact" page to create a call-to-action to reach out if they are interested in my profile.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  - The primary actions the user should take are as follows:
    a. See my portfolio
    b. Contact me for business opportunities or to say hello!

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  - After researching more about design, I realized that the key takeaway is that design, in its core, is about solving human problems. Browsing through pretty design galleries might be useful reference points and examples, but the essence of great design always comes from solving a key problem for the user, which is unique to each situation. I really like the statement that "You won't find inspiration in design galleries: just a solution to someone else's problem" 
  - User experience design will not work in every situation for every user. It has to be designed for a specific use case to promote certain user behaviors and actions. 

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  - User experience design is the process of designing and enhancing the user experience by improving the usability, accessibility and satisfaction between the user and the product
  - User experience design is extremely valuable as it enhances the satisfaction of the user. As UX design is all about solving human problems, having great design will enable the company or brand behind the product to build strong customer loyalty and retention. Knowing techniques to implement great UX design (e.g. A/B Testing, user surveys, user flows). 

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  - I found the part about designing the Surprisingly, I found most parts of the challenge pretty straightforward
