##Reflections
1. What is a wireframe?
- A wireframe is a low-fidelity visual representation of a website's layout design. Often, a wireframe represents the basic page layout structure and navigational scheme of the website's pages, as well as other important elements like web forms, etc.

2. What are the benefits of wireframing?
- Wireframing allows the developer to develop a basic layout structure of the website quickly, and use that as a basis for further refinement and iteration. It encourages the developer to critically think through the main purpose or key takeaway of the website (e.g. To purchase something / look for information / contact the website developer), and then design a layout of the website that will effectively serve this purpose. Wireframing also allows the developer to then evaluate the overall effectiveness of the page layout against usability best practices, and then determine which type of web development and/or programming are required.

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
- I really enjoyed wireframing my site. It allowed me to express my creativity to design the main structure of my website, and how the different content elements would fit in. The wireframing exercises gave me very good clarity as to what the main purpose of my website was, and how to design it. It allowed me to quickly iterate multiple times, once I had a basic layout designed.

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
- Throughout the wireframing exercises, I made some revisions along the way from the first idea as I thought through how the user of the website will navigate my website. Thinking through what key messages or actions I wanted the user to takeaway helped me to further refine the website layout.

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
- Here are some questions that I had came up during this challenge:
  - How do I create a great personal website wireframe to serve its core purpose?
  - How do I know that this iteration of my wireframe is good enough?
  - How do I create great website copywriting? 
  - 
- Here are the following resources that helped to answer some of my questions:

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
- I really enjoyed the process of planning and designing the wireframes even though it took me some time to refine and improve my wireframes. Perhaps the one thing I found tedious was working with the wireframe tool, Mockingbird. It might not be as versatile as other tools like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop. Another thing that I found tedious was website copywriting
