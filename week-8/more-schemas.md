# 8.4 More Schemas

## Release 2: One to One Schema
![One-to-one Schema](/week-8/imgs/one-to-one-schema.png "One-to-one Schema")
- This is an example of a one-to-one schema for people and driving licenses. As not everyone might have a driving license, it makes sense to break the data into two separate entities which have a one-to-one relationship between the two tables. This will reduce the number of null values in the main persons table that is more regularly accessed.
- Note that the primary key of person is id, which is the foreign key in the drivers_license table.

## Reflections
What is a one-to-one database?
- Each row in one database table is linked to 1 and only 1 other row in another table. This applies to both tables


When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
- A one-to-one database relationship is used in situations where the schema designer would like to break up data into two separate tables where some of these attributes might have null values
- In such a case, these attributes will be better off to be split into another table, with the main table only storing attributes that are most frequently accessed.
- This will help to improve efficiency of querying.

What is a many-to-many database?
- For example, in a many-to-many relationship between table A and table B: each record in A can be associated to more than one record in B, and each record in B can be associated to more than one record in A.
- To model a many-to-many relationship, two distinct tables are connected by a join table, which connects two independent tables by keeping track of the two primary IDs of the independent tables as foreign keys in the join table.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
- You would use a many-to-many database in situations where one or more rows in a table are associated with one or more rows in another table.
- Through additional research, **I learned that in relational database design, a many-to-many relationship is not allowed** To tackle this problem, a many-to-many relationship needs to be broken into two one-to-many relationships using a join table. Each record in the join table would have the foreign key fields of the two tables it is joining together.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
- The material covered so far is pretty understandable. I think the challenge will come when I start designing database schemas for complicated situations/relationships, and then translate that schema into a working relational database that is aligned with design best-practices.
